//This file deals with an ideal workflow to the game.
 
First of all, on connection to /, server will return
index.html. 

A script on index will connect to server via socket.io. 
server, on connection will emit 'game_init' event 
with two random numbers, which will instruct 
the client(index.html) to initialize game with 
two random numbers meant for two controllers. 

A QR Code will be generated in format 
www.example.com/game_id/controller_id. 'game_id' will 
be current socket id(of index.html), and'controller_id' 
will be two random numbers returned by server.

When the controllers connect, they will connect on 
/game_id/controller_id. Each time they will conect, 
they will emit 'controller_connected' event to 
index.html, which will turn the player status to ready, 
and also register the corrosponding socket_id from which
connection is coming. 

Whenever the player will slide their fingers, it will 
send 'goLeft' and 'goRight' event. server will send 
this event to index.html, which will move the paddle
on the basis of socket_id which requested it.
